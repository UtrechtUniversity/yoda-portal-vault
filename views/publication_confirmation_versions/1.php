<br>
<br>7. CONFIDENTIALITY
<br>
<br>7.1 Neither Party may use, disclose or make available to any third party the other Party’s Confidential Information, unless such use or disclosure is done in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
<br>7.2 Each Party must hold the other Party’s Confidential Information secure and in confidence, except to the extent that such Confidential Information:

<br>b. was approved for release in writing by the other Party, but only to the extent of and subject to such conditions as may be imposed in such written authorization.
<br>
<br>7.3 This clause 7 will survive termination of this Agreement.
<br>
<br>8. DISCLAIMERS & RELEASE
<br>
<br>8.1 To the extent permitted by law, Licensor will in no way be liable to the Licensee or any third party for any loss or damage, however caused (including through negligence) which may be directly or indirectly suffered in connection with any use of the Asset.
